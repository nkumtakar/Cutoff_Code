## Insttructions for running the Cuttoff Code 

1.  Run Cuttoff_Code.R first in order to load the functions into R first. VERY IMPORTANT
2. Make sure that the Test Set has the binary dependent variable at the last column 
3. You are free to use the Code. Be sure to look at the Test_Code.R for a working example.
